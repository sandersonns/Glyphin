# Glyphin

Glyphin is a location-based web app where users leave spatial memories called 'glyphs'. Beyond marking locations, it encourages active conversations around each glyph and facilitates direct chats, merging geography with dynamic community interactions.

For all intents and purposes, my aim for this project is to create a medium where users can 'glyph' memorable notes/marks at specific spots using a special coordinate system. Glyphs can be public or private/intimate â€” public glyphs welcome anyone who visits the spot, while private ones are an enigma, unlocked only by their creator or those holding a special token. Beyond leaving their mark, users can engage in direct chats, and hopefully each glyph can foster discussions and emotional interactions.


The coordinate system I intend to integrate is 'what3words': a proprietary geocode system designed to identify any location on the surface of Earth in a unique combination of three words. Check for more info at: https://what3words.com/
